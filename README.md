## Automate tasks: Let your computer do the work for you 

Inspired with the book 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' written by Al Sweigart and an online Udemy course, I've made this repo 
to collect all useful scripts. Those were built during my learning journey from the need for creation something useful on a daily basis.

I've used also project inspiration from Data Rebelion Ebook: 88 Python Project Ideas for Automating Your Life.

However the biggest inspiration was my daily life challanges.
